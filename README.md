Hello! This is one of my few projects!

It's a game called Crystal, made using Unity C#. It is a scroll runner made in 2.5D perspective.
The player can move in 3 diferent lanes, trying to avoid being hit by the enemies while collecting as much coins as possible.

The game has both spanish and english support.

Every script is made from scratch by me. There are some assets that I downloaded from the Unity Store, such as some SFX or particles.
